# rl
some of my python scripts fro reinforcement learning

## Overview
So far most scripts are for the examples from Barto and Sutton's book (2nd edition) http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/the-book.html

## Dependency
Python 2.X + {pygame,matplotlib} tested on Ubuntu 14.04

## List (so far)
1. gridworld.py: a GUI example (random policy) and DP demo

2. blackjack_GUITest.py: a demo for plotting the animation plot of the learned value function.

2. blackjack_sol.py: a demo for the blackjack example, MC with Exploring Start and animation plot of the learned policy function. Somehow, 
the policy does not match the book's description, to be fixed.
